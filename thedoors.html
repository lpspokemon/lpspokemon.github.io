    It's raining. You're driving down some small road off Route 80. You can barley see in front of you.
    You would usually never be driving out this late but you had to get home. 
    </p>
<p style="color:pink; font-family:alef; font-size:100%">
  You cant remember why you have to get home. you just know you do.
    </p>
      <p style="color:white; font-family:alef; font-size:130%">
 You suddenly see something appear in front of you. You can't make it out. But you know you're going to hit it if you don't swearve out the way.

            what just happened? You slowly open your eyes. Your car is slammed into the tree before you. You slowly try to asess the damage. No broken bones. you think. You slowly start to move your body starting with your toes. nothing, no bleeding, no bruises. nothing.
    </p>
    <p style="color:white; font-family:alef; font-size:130%">
      You slowly get out of the car, it's still raining. 
    </p>
    <p style="color:pink; font-family:alef; font-size:100%">
      This reminds me of rocky horror picture show... 
    </p>
      <p style="color:white; font-family:alef; font-size:130%">
        You lok out onto the road. nothing. there's nothing here, that you can see at least.
    </p>
     <p style="color:white; font-family:alef; font-size:130%">
       You decide to keep walking the direction you were heading. No use in staying here for god knows how long.
       You walk.
    </p>
     <p style="color:white; font-family:alef; font-size:120%">
       and walk.

       You oddly never looked up. always keeing your eyes low. This led to you suddenly landing near a house.
  
    </p>
    <p style="color:pink; font-family:alef; font-size:100%">
     Too much like rocky horror picture show...
    </p>
     <p style="color:white; font-family:alef; font-size:130%">
       There was one light. right in center, the window above the door. But not on the first floor, on the second.
       You decide to walk closer. There could be people there.
